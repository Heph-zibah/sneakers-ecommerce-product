## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow CSS Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me to genrate box shadow. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Sang Le](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/ecommerce-product-page-with-reactjs-BJynD7RBc) - This is an amazing solution which helped me finally understand lightbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
